        "\n",
        "This notebook is adapted from the Colab notebook available at https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will directly modify the code blocks as instructed below (look for **A3 task xx **) to perform the following tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Train on the GenomicBenchmarks dataset from scratch and fine-tune (sequence level classification tasks)\n",
        "2.   Do inference on sequences to examine the sequence embedding via t-SNE visualization\n",
        "3.   Implement next token prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Open the \"Table of contents\" on the left to help you navigate the codeblocks and identify the ones that require modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the rest of the codeblocks, simply click through them **without making any change**. You are encouraged to read and understand each codeblock. But we will only grade the assigned code blocks and the desired outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are recommended to run the code using Colab. By the default Colab connects to a CPU node. To speed up the training, you may connect with a T4 GPU by choosing 'Runtime' in the top menu and then clicking on 'Change runtime type' and choose 'T4 GPU'. Note that for free Google account, we can keep the notebook connected to a GPU for at most 12 hours. Nonetheless, all the training and inference required to complete this assignment can be done within 5 minutes even with a CPU.\n",

        "To use your 6-day quota as a team, submit your request by emailing Liam Hodgson (liam.hodgson@mcgill.ca) with subject title ``Assignment 3 extension request\" and in the email body specify the number of days (max at 6 days) you need to submit your assignment. You can only submit the request ONCE. Therefore, plan and use your quota wisely."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
